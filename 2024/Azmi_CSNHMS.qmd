## Overview of NHMS

1.  **Nationwide Health Survey**: Conducted by the Ministry of Health Malaysia to assess the health and healthcare needs of Malaysians.
2.  **Regularly Conducted**: Since 1986, NHMS has been conducted with varying intervals, focusing on different health themes.
3.  **Key Health Indicators**: Focuses on topics like Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), infectious diseases, and healthcare demand.
4.  **Representative Sampling**: Nationally representative, covering different states, age groups, and ethnicities.
5.  **Policy Impact**: NHMS findings guide national health policies and strategies.

## NHMS Reports

-   NHMS reports are available on the Institute for Public Health (IKU) website.

# Census vs Survey

## Census vs Survey

-   **Census**: Collects data from every individual in a population. It's costly, time-consuming, and not feasible for large populations.
    -   e.g., DOSM conducts a Population and Housing Census every 10 years.
-   **Survey**: Collects data from a sample of the population. More cost-effective and quicker but raises the question of representation.

## Why Not Simple Random Sampling (SRS)?

-   **Simple Random Sampling (SRS)**: Every individual theoretically has an equal chance of selection.
    -   Impractical for large, diverse populations.
    -   Assumes homogeneity, which leads to biases, especially with underrepresented groups.
-   **Challenges of SRS**:
    -   Requires a complete list of the population for equal chance selection, which is often unavailable.

# Simple Random Sampling (SRS) – Simulation

## The Risk of Underrepresentation

-   SRS may not represent minority groups adequately.

. . . 

-   Hypothetical Population, In a population of 1,000:
    -   46% Malay, 33% Chinese, 25% Indian, 1% Borneo.


```{r}
sim_pop <- tibble(ethnicity = c(rep("Malay", 460), 
                                rep("Chinese", 330), 
                                rep("Indian", 250), 
                                rep("Borneo", 10))) %>% 
  mutate(ethnicity = fct_relevel(ethnicity, "Malay", "Chinese", "Indian"))

sim_pop %>% 
  count(ethnicity) %>% mutate(pct = scales::label_percent()(n/1000))
```

## The Risk of Underrepresentation

-   Taking an SRS of 50 people, will the Borneo group (1%) be included?

```{r}
sim_pop %>% sample_n(50) %>% 
  count(ethnicity) %>% mutate(pct = scales::label_percent()(n/50))
```

. . .

-   Let's try it again:

```{r}
sim_pop %>% sample_n(50) %>% 
  count(ethnicity) %>% mutate(pct = scales::label_percent()(n/50))
```

## Key Takeaways from the Simulation

-   And One More Time

```{r}
sim_pop %>% sample_n(50) %>% 
  count(ethnicity) %>% mutate(pct = scales::label_percent()(n/50))
```

. . .

-   As shown in this short simulation, **Simple Random Sampling** may or may not select individuals from the **Borneo** group, which makes up only 1% of the population.
-   To ensure that the **Borneo** group is properly represented in the sample, we may need to use **stratified sampling** to guarantee their inclusion.




# Complex Sampling Design in NHMS

## NHMS Complex Sampling

-   NHMS applies stratification (State and Urban/Rural) and clustering (DOSM's enumeration blocks) to ensure representation.
-   Two-stage Sampling:
    -   **Primary Sampling Unit (PSU)**: Enumeration Blocks (EBs).
    -   **Secondary Sampling Units (SSU)**: Living Quarters (LQs) within EBs.
-   Impact on Sampling: Stratification and clustering affect sampling probabilities, requiring the use of sampling weights.

# NHMS 2023

## NHMS 2023 Overview

-   Theme: **Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) & Healthcare Demand**.
-   Data collected from 11 July to 29 September 2023.
    -   5,006 households visited.
    -   13,616 respondents, representing the Malaysian adult population (\~22 million).

## NHMS 2023 Overview

![](Images/NHMS2024_IKUPage.png)

## NHMS 2023: Findings

- NHMS 2023 included various modules focusing on **Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)** and **healthcare demand**.
- The **cholesterol module** was conducted using WHO's **STEPwise approach**, which is a standardized method for collecting and analysing health data.
- Among the respondents, **4,353 individuals** were identified as having **raised total cholesterol** levels.
- This represents a **33.3% prevalence** of raised cholesterol, translating to an estimated **7.6 million Malaysian adults** with high cholesterol.



# Simulation and Analysis of Complex Sampling Design

## Purpose of Simulation

-   Objective: Demonstrate how complex sampling design is applied in practice, mimicking the National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) setup.
-   Population Data: We simulate data using population estimates from OpenDOSM to replicate the adult population (ages 20-59) for Malaysia.
-   Disease Data: Simulated based on characteristics such as BMI, age, gender, and ethnicity to study cholesterol prevalence.


## Simulating Population

-   Target Population:
    -   We focus on three main ethnicities (Malay, Chinese, Indian), and simulate both male and female participants between 20-59 years of age.


## Simulating Population

-   OpenDOSM Population Data: Used for population distribution across states and districts, forming the basis for the simulated population.

                                "Chinese" = "chinese", 
                                "Indian" = "indian"), 
         population = population * 1000)
```

```

. . .

```{r}


pop_mydist %>% 
  summarise(population = sum(population)) %>% 
  mutate(population = scales::label_comma()(population))

```

## Simulating Population

-   Stratification by Zone:
    -   Malaysia is divided into five zones (Utara, Selatan, Timur, Tengah, Borneo).
    -   For each zone, two districts are randomly selected.


```{r}
#| eval: false

set.seed(121)
selected_district <- pop_mydist %>% 
  distinct(state, district) %>% 
  mutate(zone = case_when(state %in% c("Johor", "Melaka", "Negeri Sembilan") ~ "Selatan", 
                         state %in% c("Kedah", "Perak", "Perlis", "Pulau Pinang") ~ "Utara", 
                         state %in% c("Kelantan", "Pahang", "Terengganu") ~ "Timur", 
                         state %in% c("Selangor", "W.P. Kuala Lumpur", "W.P. Putrajaya") ~ "Tengah", 
                         state %in% c("Sabah", "Sarawak", "W.P. Labuan") ~ "Borneo")) %>% 
  group_by(zone) %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 2) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  relocate(zone, .before = 1)

selected_district
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false

write_rds(selected_district, "Source/selected_district.rds")
```

## 

```{r}
#| echo: false

selected_district <- read_rds("Source/selected_district.rds")
selected_district 
```



## Simulating Participants

-   Sample Size: 40 participants are selected from each of the 10 districts.
-   Variables Simulated: Variables such as gender, age, ethnicity, BMI, and hba1c are simulated to reflect realistic population characteristics.
-   Disease Data: The hba1c variable is used to categorize participants as diabetic or non-diabetic.

## Define Simulation (simstudy package)

```{r}

#| eval: false

library(simstudy)

def <- defData(varname = "gender", dist = "binary", formula = 0.5, 
               link = "identity") %>% 
  defData(varname = "age", dist = "uniform", formula = "20;59") %>% 
  defData(varname = "ethnicity", dist = "categorical", 
          formula = "0.57;0.29;0.14") %>% 
  defData(varname = "BMI", dist = "normal", formula = 26, variance = 2.6^2) %>% 
  defData(varname = "height", dist = "normal", formula = 165, variance = 5) %>% 
  defData(varname = "PAhour", dist = "uniform", formula = "2;6") %>% 
  defData(varname = "hba1c", dist = "normal", variance = 1.4^2, 
          formula = "2.4 + 0.05 * age + 0.1 * BMI - 0.15 * PAhour")
```

## Generate Dataset (simstudy package)

```{r}

#| eval: false

set.seed(121)
simnhmsds0 <- genData(400, def) %>% 
  mutate(gender = case_when(gender == 0 ~ "Male", 
                            gender == 1 ~ "Female"), 
         agegp = cut(age, 
                     breaks = c(19, 29, 39, 49, 59), 
                     labels = c("20-29", "30-39", "40-49", "50-59")), 
         ethnicity = case_when(ethnicity == 1 ~ "Malay", 
                               ethnicity == 2 ~ "Chinese", 
                               ethnicity == 3 ~ "Indian"), 
         weight = BMI * (height/100)^2, 
         across(.cols = c(hba1c, weight), 
                .fns = ~ round(., 1)), 
         across(.cols = c(height), 
                .fns = ~ round(., 2)), 
         district = rep(1:10, each = 40), 
         dm_dx = cut(hba1c, 
                     breaks = c(0, 6.49, 10), 
                     labels = c("0", "1")), 
         dm_dx = as.numeric(dm_dx) - 1, 
         across(.cols = c(district, age, height, PAhour, dm_dx), 
                .fns = ~ as.integer(.))) %>% 
  relocate(weight, .after = height) %>% 
  select(id, district, everything(), -BMI) %>% 
  right_join(selected_district %>% mutate(n = 1:10), ., 
            by = c("n" = "district")) %>% 
  select(id, zone:district, gender:age, agegp, everything(), -n)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false

write_rds(simnhmsds0, "Source/simnhmsds0.rds")
```

## 

```{r}
#| echo: false

simnhmsds0 <- read_rds("Source/simnhmsds0.rds")
```

```{r}


head(simnhmsds0, 15)
```

## Simulating Non-response

-   Non-response Adjustment: Different response rates are applied by zone (e.g., 36/40 for Utara), and the sampling weights are adjusted accordingly.
-   Simulation of Non-response: The dataset is adjusted to reflect these response rates, ensuring the final dataset accounts for real-world data collection challenges.

## Simulating Non-response

```{r}


sample_sizes <- list("Utara" = 36, "Selatan" = 34, 
                     "Timur" = 38, "Tengah" = 32, "Borneo" = 38)

simnhmsds_split <- simnhmsds0 %>%
  group_split(zone, .keep = TRUE)

set.seed(121)
simnhmsds_final <- map(simnhmsds_split, function(data) {
  zone <- unique(data$zone)
  data %>%
    group_by(district) %>%
    slice_sample(n = sample_sizes[[zone]]) %>%
    ungroup()
}) %>%
  bind_rows() %>% 
  arrange(id) %>% 
  mutate(success = 1, 
         .before = 1)
```

## Sampling Weights Calculation

-   Design Weights (W1):
    -   Calculated as the inverse probability of selecting a district within its respective zone.
    -   Ensures that smaller districts are adequately represented in the final analysis.
-   Non-response Adjustment Factor (F):
    -   The inverse of the response rate for each district.
    -   Adjusts the design weight to account for missing data due to non-response.

## Sampling Weights Calculation

-   Post-stratification Adjustment (PS)
    -   Ensures that the sample reflects the actual population distribution by gender, age group, and ethnicity.
    -   Uses the population data to adjust for any over- or under-representation in the sample.

## Design Weight (W1)

-   Design Weights (W1):
    -   Calculated as the inverse probability of selecting a district within its respective zone.
    -   Ensures that smaller districts are adequately represented in the final analysis.

## Design Weight (W1)

```{r}
design_weight <- pop_mydist %>% 
  distinct(state, district) %>% 
  mutate(zone = case_when(state %in% c("Johor", "Melaka", "Negeri Sembilan") ~ "Selatan", 
                         state %in% c("Kedah", "Perak", "Perlis", "Pulau Pinang") ~ "Utara", 
                         state %in% c("Kelantan", "Pahang", "Terengganu") ~ "Timur", 
                         state %in% c("Selangor", "W.P. Kuala Lumpur", "W.P. Putrajaya") ~ "Tengah", 
                         state %in% c("Sabah", "Sarawak", "W.P. Labuan") ~ "Borneo")) %>% 
  count(zone) %>% 
  rename(total_district = n) %>% 
  mutate(selected_district = 2, 
         f1 = selected_district / total_district, 
         W1 = 1/f1)

design_weight
```

## Design Weight (W1)

-   We use survey and srvyr package to recalculate the design weight by district

```{r}
library(survey)
library(srvyr)

district_ws <- simnhmsds_final %>% 
  left_join(., 
            design_weight %>% 
              select(zone, W1), 
            by = "zone") %>% 
  as_survey_design(id = 1, 
                   weight = W1) %>% 
  group_by(district) %>% 
  summarise(district_w1 = survey_total(success), 
            .groups = "drop")
```

## Design Weight (W1)

```{r}
district_ws
```


## Non-response Adjustment Factor (F)

-   Non-response Adjustment Factor (F):
    -   The inverse of the response rate for each district.
    -   Adjusts the design weight to account for missing data due to non-response.

```{r}
#| eval: false

nonresponse_weight <- selected_district %>% 
  mutate(fnr = case_when(zone == "Utara" ~ 36/40, 
                       zone == "Selatan" ~ 34/40, 
                       zone == "Timur" ~ 38/40, 
                       zone == "Tengah" ~ 32/40, 
                       zone == "Borneo" ~ 38/40), 
         Fw = 1/fnr)

nonresponse_weight
```


## Non-response Adjustment Factor (F)

```{r}
#| echo: false

nonresponse_weight <- selected_district %>% 
  mutate(fnr = case_when(zone == "Utara" ~ 36/40, 
                       zone == "Selatan" ~ 34/40, 
                       zone == "Timur" ~ 38/40, 
                       zone == "Tengah" ~ 32/40, 
                       zone == "Borneo" ~ 38/40), 
         Fw = 1/fnr)

nonresponse_weight
```


## Non-response Adjustment Factor (F)

-   The non-response adjustment factor (F) is calculated for each district based on the response rate.

```{r}
district_adw <- nonresponse_weight %>% 
  left_join(., 
            district_ws %>% 
              select(district, district_w1), 
            by = "district") %>% 
  mutate(district_adw = district_w1 * Fw)

district_adw
```


## Post-stratification Adjustment (PS)

-   Post-stratification Adjustment (PS)
    -   Ensures that the sample reflects the actual population distribution by gender, age group, and ethnicity.
    -   Uses the population data to adjust for any over- or under-representation in the sample.


## Total Population by Post-strat Group

```{r}
ps_pop <- pop_mydist %>% 
  mutate(agegp = case_when(age %in% c("20-24", "24-29") ~ "20-29", 
                          age %in% c("30-34", "35-39") ~ "30-39", 
                          age %in% c("40-44", "45-49") ~ "40-49", 
                          age %in% c("50-54", "55-59") ~ "50-59")) %>% 
  group_by(gender, agegp, ethnicity) %>% 
  summarise(population = sum(population), 
            .groups = "drop")

ps_pop %>% 
  mutate(popcoma = scales::label_comma()(population))
```

## Post-stratification Adjustment (PS)

-   The adjusted weight is attached back to our dataset, and post-stratification weight is calculated using survey and srvyr package.

```{r}
ps_weight <- simnhmsds_final %>% 
  left_join(., 
            district_adw %>% 
              select(district, district_adw), 
            by = join_by(district)) %>% 
  as_survey_design(id = 1, 
                   weights = district_adw) %>% 
  group_by(gender, agegp, ethnicity) %>% 
  summarise(ps_adw = survey_total(success), 
            .groups = "drop") %>% 
  select(-ps_adw_se) %>% 
  left_join(simnhmsds_final %>% 
              count(gender, agegp, ethnicity), 
            ., 
            by = join_by(gender, agegp, ethnicity)) %>% 
  left_join(., 
            ps_pop,
            by = join_by(gender, agegp, ethnicity)) %>% 
  mutate(fps = population / ps_adw, 
         final_weight = 1/fps)
```


## Post-stratification Adjustment (PS)

-   The adjusted weight is attached back to our dataset, and post-stratification weight is calculated using survey and srvyr package.

```{r}
ps_weight
```



## Attaching Final Weight to Dataset

-   The final weight is attached to the dataset for further analysis.

```{r}
simnhmsds_weight <-  simnhmsds_final %>% 
  left_join(., 
            ps_weight %>% 
              select(gender, agegp, ethnicity, final_weight), 
            by = join_by(gender, agegp, ethnicity))

simnhmsds_weight
```


# Analyzing the Data

## Survey Design Object:

-   The `svydesign()` function from the survey package is used to define the complex survey design.
-   We account for stratification, clustering, and weighting to accurately estimate population parameters.
-   Parameters:
    -   `ids`: cluster id. ~1 if no cluster
    -   `probs` or `weights`: sampling probability or weight, use only one
    -   `strata`: strata id. NULL (or leave unspecified) if no strata
    -   `data`: dataset   

## Unweighted Design


```{r}
unwt_dsg <- svydesign(ids = ~1, 
                      weights = 1, 
                      data = simnhmsds_weight)

summary(unwt_dsg)
```
    
## Weighted Design


```{r}
wtds_dsg <- svydesign(ids = ~district, 
                      weights = ~final_weight, 
                      strata = ~zone,
                      data = simnhmsds_weight)

summary(wtds_dsg)
```


## Estimating Population Prevalence

-   We calculate estimates for key outcomes (e.g., prevalence of diabetes) using weighted data to ensure valid, representative conclusions.


```{r}
svymean(x = ~dm_dx, 
         design = wtds_dsg, 
         na.rm = T)
```


## Variance Estimation:

-   Variance is estimated using complex sampling design techniques to ensure accurate confidence intervals for population estimates.


```{r}
svyciprop(formula = ~dm_dx, 
         design = wtds_dsg) %>% 
  attr(., "ci")
```

## Subgroup Analysis

-   For subpopulation analysis, we can use `svyby( )` function

```{r}
svyby(formula = ~dm_dx, 
      by = ~gender, 
      design = wtds_dsg, 
      FUN = svymean, 
      na.rm = T)
```
