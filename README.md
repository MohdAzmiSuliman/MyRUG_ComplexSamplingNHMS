# Estimating Prevalence Correctly

## Complex Sampling in National Health Surveys (MyRUG 2024 & 2025)

This repository contains materials from two Malaysia R User Group R Conference sessions (2024 and 2025) on estimating prevalence correctly using complex sampling, survey weights, and post-stratification. Each year’s slides and materials are located in the corresponding folder.

All examples use synthetic data for demonstration.
Feel free to explore the folders for slides, R scripts, and Quarto files.
